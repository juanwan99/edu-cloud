Use live commands for volatile values such as exact `HEAD`, ahead/behind count,
and active grading-task progress:

```bash
scripts/codex-context --no-network
scripts/meta-check --json --strict --task "current user task"
scripts/guardian-watch --once --no-network --no-model-review
scripts/truth-status.sh /home/ops/projects/edu-cloud
scripts/truth doctor --json
```

## Current Facts

- Branch: `master`
- Upstream: `origin/master`
- Production URL: `https://mcu.asia`
- Backend API: `127.0.0.1:9000`
- Frontend artifact path: `frontend/dist/`
- Known pytest baseline entries: 26 in `.quality/known-pytest-failures.txt`
- DB doctor: ok, Alembic `ed1f8408241c`, hard=0, warn=0
- Runtime services: `edu-cloud.service`, `llm-proxy.service`, and
  `edu-cloud-worker.service` are active.
- `edu-cloud-worker.service` is installed and enabled from
  `deploy/systemd/edu-cloud-worker.service`.

## Truthline

The latest verified delivery path is:

- tracked source clean
- frontend build inputs clean
- `frontend/dist/version.json` has `source_dirty=false`
- `https://mcu.asia/version.json` matches local `frontend/dist/version.json`
- backend `/api/v1/version` matches the same git hash

Run `scripts/truth-status.sh /home/ops/projects/edu-cloud` for the live hash.
Any `BROKEN AT:` diagnosis exits non-zero and blocks completion evidence.

## Codex Migration State

Codex-native migration layer is now committed:

- `AGENTS.md`: active Codex entrypoint.
- `docs/context/GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`: 元守双核心 model.
- `docs/context/META_RUNTIME.md`: Meta Core task-contract runtime.
- `docs/context/**`: current facts, commands, lessons, safety matrix, active
  index, artifact policy, and Claude auxiliary protocol.
- `scripts/codex-context`: current project summary.
- `scripts/codex-check`: read-only start-of-work preflight.
- `scripts/meta-check`: synchronous Meta Core runtime. It emits
  `meta.core.v1` snapshots and can write `logs/meta-state.json` for the latest
  task contract. `scripts/codex-verify full` runs `scripts/meta-check --strict`
  before backend/frontend gates. Deep checks include `--check-drift` for
  baseline obligation loss and `--check-recent-plans` for committed plan
  evidence gaps.
- `scripts/codex-consult-claude`: read-only Claude Code auxiliary reviewer
  wrapper. It injects current `logs/meta-state.json` obligations into the review
  prompt when available.
- `scripts/codex-verify`: completion verification wrapper with `safety`,
  `frontend`, `backend`, `schema`, and `full` modes.
- `scripts/guardian-watch`: realtime Guardian Core runtime. It emits
  `guardian.watch.v1` snapshots and can run continuously from
  `deploy/systemd/edu-cloud-guardian.service`.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: governance, backend, and frontend CI smoke.

The governance model is formally **元守双核心**:

- Meta Core / 元控核: owns direction, facts, task boundaries, context, Claude
  read-only counter-review, and the completion evidence contract.
- Guardian Core / 守护核: owns dirty state, truthline, DB/migration gates,
  safety scanning, frontend/backend build-runtime consistency, and environment
  hygiene.

Meta runtime boundary:

- allowed: classify active-context, NOW freshness, lesson, registration,
  Claude-boundary, changed/recent plan evidence, and task-obligation drift
- allowed: write `logs/meta-state.json` when explicitly run with
  `--write-state`
- forbidden: auto-edit files, override user instructions, let Claude/GPT claim
  completion, run builds/migrations/deploys, or replace Guardian realtime
  monitoring

Guardian realtime runtime boundary:

- allowed: observe, classify, write `logs/guardian-state.json`, append
  `logs/guardian-watch.jsonl`, and schedule rate-limited read-only Claude
  reviews through `scripts/codex-consult-claude`
- forbidden: auto-kill workers/services/Claude sessions, auto-delete
  DB/WAL/SHM/dirty source/experiment data, run git cleanup, run migrations,
  build, or deploy

## AI Grading State

The AI grading prompt/rubric/guard changes are committed. Targeted AI grading
tests have no new failures; the remaining prompt test failure is part of the
known baseline.

Live grading jobs can run for hours. A legacy shell-started ARQ worker may still
be processing jobs started before `edu-cloud-worker.service` was installed. Do
not kill it unless you accept ARQ cancellation/retry risk; after it drains,
stop the legacy process and rerun `scripts/truth doctor --json`.

## Artifact State

Local experiment and runtime artifacts are ignored rather than committed:

- active SQLite WAL/SHM files, classified as runtime state by `codex-context`
- stale migration lock files
- `.codex` and `frontend/.codex`
- backups and screenshots
- local AI grading experiment data/scripts listed in `ARTIFACT_POLICY.md`

Do not copy active SQLite databases with `cp` or `rsync`.

## Do Not Do

- Do not clean ignored artifacts blindly.
- Do not overwrite AI grading source changes from older handoffs.
- Do not run direct Alembic migration commands.
- Do not copy active SQLite DB files.
- Do not use old Windows-era docs as current facts.
